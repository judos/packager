IN PROGRESS:

Concept for configurable boxes:

! control table references active amount of chests per configuration
+ 2 recipes for configurable-packager (allows empty boxes and filled ones to be in input slot)
  recipes need 2000 input items, more than stack-size, so will never be completed
+ item feeders work similar to slipStreamChest, spawn 2x2 on packager
- item feeders mode is set by packager

? Can packager accept recipe as module?
? 1 recipe for configurable-packager to configure packaging blueprint


DONE:
- item feeders have no image, 1 stack inventory, not minable or destroyable, despawn with packager
! blueprint library (is basically a chest with some control)

FURTHER IDEAS:
- smelt ores directly from boxes to boxes

x Wood, Iron gears, Electronic circuit, copper-cable
 -> This is blocked due to raw ressources calculation of factorio (crafting recipes are screwed up then)
