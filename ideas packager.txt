Concept for configurable boxes:

! control table references active amount of chests per configuration
+ blueprint library (is basically a chest with some control)
+ 2 recipes for configurable-packager (allows boxes to be in input slot)
  recipes need 2000 input items, more than stack-size, so will never be completed
+ 1 recipe for configurable-packager to configure packaging blueprint
+ item feeders work similar to slipStreamChest, spawn 2x2 on packager
- item feeders have no image, 1 stack inventory, not minable or destroyable, despawn with packager
- item feeders mode is set by packager



- decide yourself how to fill mixed boxes
- smelt ores directly from boxes to boxes
